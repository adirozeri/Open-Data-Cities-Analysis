# Open Data Cities Analysis
This repository provides an interactive and welcoming environment for data enthusiasts to learn and gain valuable experience through working with real-world open data from cities around the world. Each city will have a dedicated folder containing all analyses created for that city's data, providing an interactive and highly informative environment.

We encourage users to explore and analyze open-data from cities around the world, and submit meaningful Pull Requests to share their results. Through this repository, we hope to enable users to gain valuable experience while also encouraging cities to open their data to the public.
